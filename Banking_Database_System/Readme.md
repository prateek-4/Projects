### Implementation of different hashing algorithms and assessing their performance

- Designed and built a custom hash function to manage bank databases, ensuring efficient data storage & retrieval.
- Implemented tables using arrays and linked lists
- Investigated effect of different probing strategies, linear, quadratic, etc
- Investigated effect of different hash functions, CRC16, CRC32, etc

## Usage
To test the various methods of hashing such as cubic , linear and quadratics probing , create a main file in cpp and use #include linear_probing etc. and use the required functions . At the time of compilation , compile all three files(.h,.cpp and main file) together. For time comparision use std::chrono
